# "A Locked Cabin" Puzzle Game
# Sam Clear, Noah Schonhorn

## Summary
This is a point-and-click puzzle game, set in a cabin in the woods,
where the goal is to get all the items you need to break out.

## Details
There are several items inside the cabin that will assist you in 
your escape:
- Safe
- Table (removable leg!)
- Vase
- Painting
- Envelope
- Lockpick
- Tension Wrench
- Bomb
- Candle
- Lighter
- Knife
- Iron Rod
- Hammer

And, the things that need to be taken care of in order to get out:
- Key 
- Padlock (x2)
- Chain
- Leather Strap
- Door

Certain things need to be used in certain orders to progress (i.e.
use the hammer on the vase, to get the bomb to use on the safe), so make
sure you grab everything you need before the candle lighting the 
room burns out.

## Known Errors
Currently, there are no known errors. There are a number of warnings
thrown during compilation (from the code provided to us), but beyond that,
there isn't anything game breaking.

## Future Work
There are a handful of quality-of-life features that could make the game
more complete. A more fully featured HUD, prettier graphics (loading
textures from file), and a more robust inventory bar would all benefit
the gameplay experience.
